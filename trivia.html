Hey, cucks! Today I'm gonna learn ya some shit about my site, like how it was made!<br>

<b>How it was Made</b>
	</font>
<hr>
	My website was coded completely in HTML. No joke.<br>
As I said before on my main page, I partially coded this on my old laptop in bed<br>
and my main computer. This website is entirely made in HTML and hosted on Github<br>
Pages. However, when I get the money, I'll move this all over to an actual web<br>
domain (most likely HostGator) instead of sticking with this dumb free option.<br>
Now, about how I coded this. I learned most of my HTML by looking up websites,<br>
but how I learned how to make tables was inspect elementing pages like <a href="http://imagingone.ddns.net/">ImagingOne</a><br>
and other pages to learn even more. The graphics at the top besides the ad was<br>
all made in Anonymous Program* except for the crazy person logo, which was drawn by<br>
yours truly in Anonymous Program*. The reason I'm naming these anonymous?<br>
Well, that's simple. I'm not just gonna bend over for everyone saying "oh yea<br>
this is the program i use its free" because if you do that, you're just a pussy.<br>
If you wanna know what program people use, maybe, oh I don't know, google it?<br>
Maybe get off your lazy ass for once and stop asking people questions? I already<br>
get around 15-20 messages a day on Discord from strangers asking "dude wat program<br>
is that and how do you use it" and I simply don't wanna answer those fucking questions<br>
Now, there's only one thing I'll tell you. I coded this all in Notepad++. If you<br>
don't know what that is, I don't know what planet or mental challenges you have,<br>
but God knows I'm not worried about you.

<b>Trivia</b>
	</font>
<hr>
	When I first coded this website, oh man, was it shit. I barely knew HTML.<br>
The most I knew was probably font, hr, and br. And even then I didn't really<br>
understand them that much. Now I'm so used to using that shit, I barely ever<br>
have to recycle code unless it's a table, because I'm not gonna spend my fucking<br>
time on doing 8 lines of fucking code just to make some basic HTML shit.<br>
This website also uses no divs. From what I see, divs are just a dumb way to<br>
organize your shit, but I already damn well know what I'm writing my code in<br>
and I don't wanna waste my time accidentally forgetting to put /div. It's a<br>
waste of time and not-all-too-much effort and if you're gonna have a simple<br>
page like this all the time, I don't think you'll have to do that. Anyways,<br>
the ad that you see in the top corner on every page was made in MS Paint<br>
on my old laptop with a mouse. And whenever I get the possibility to, I always<br>
save every image on here as a .gif file so it has a pixellated look to it.<br>
This site originally was only one page. There was only one category called Dump<br>
which later became Old Pages. It had like, 5 useless things on there and<br>
a gallery. If I showed you my website before, you had probably seen that.<br>
In fact, some of the old files, like images, are still in the Github repository.<br>
I never just dump images into the repository anymore and instead I just<br>
put the images on imgur, copy the image link, and use that.
