The End of Team Etile
</font>
	<hr>
	On 3/19/2017, Team Etile was discontinued.<br>
Team Etile, if you couldn't tell already, was a joke<br>
"hacker" group with a few members in it. There was a<br>
levelling system, a way we would "hack" people called<br>
taping, and, well, a lot of edgy jokes. The main reason<br>
I made this site was to add to the early 2000 dumb edgy<br>
style of this, and also to test out my knowledge of HTML.<br>
Not all of the pages were finished. Instead, Chen, Rocket<br>
and Sovn were the only pages for our members created.<br>
I had more little plans for this site, and well, Team<br>
Etile was already getting kinda stale with the same jokes.<br>
Eventually, I left Members Arena, BTS, and a lot of other servers<br>
and then I posted a message in Team Etile saying how I was<br>
thinking of quitting Team Etile. Rocket agreed, and the reason<br>
I wanted to was because I basically lost my reputation with<br>
the Builders community and nobody in MA liked me. This<br>
ended up making everyone leave the server and me deleting it.<br>
The sad part about this was that now I've kind of lost contact<br>
with the only people I liked in the community. I would rejoin<br>
BTS, but I just don't wanna be associated with it and only talk<br>
to the friends I actually wanna keep. So, this page is no longer<br>
being updated and I'll be focusing on my main webpage.<br>
